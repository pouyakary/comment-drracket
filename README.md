# Kary Section Comment for DrRacket

For all racketeers out there using DrRacket as their IDE, this is a very basic [QuickScript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/index.html) that generates a special 60-column-width Kary Section Comment. It lacks so much (given a codebase reduced from thousands of lines to probably 5), There are no:

- Refactor/rename
- Character integrity check
- Name case fixing
- Size checking

So you have to first select the whole line and then do the `Option-y` to get it right if things break I'm sorry!
